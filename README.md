Contributing to Esri Open Source Projects
=========================================

Esri welcomes contributions to our [open source projects](http://esri.github.io/) on Github.

Issues

Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests.

Contributing
------------

Please refer to each project's style guidelines and guidelines for submitting patches and additions. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. *Fork* the repo on GitHub
 2. *Clone* the project to your own machine
 3. *Commit* changes to your own branch
 4. *Push* your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a *Pull request* so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from `upstream` before submitting a pull request!

Github's [Guides](https://guides.github.com/) are a great resource if you're new to the process.
