### Esri Code of Conduct FAQ

#### Why have you adopted a Code of Conduct?

We think the Esri community is awesome. If you're familiar with the Esri community, you'll probably notice that the Code basically matches what we already do. Think of this as documentation: we're taking implicit expectations about behavior and making them explicit.

We know that the Esri community is open, friendly, and welcoming. We want to make sure everyone else knows it too.

#### What does it mean to "adopt" a Code of Conduct?

For the most part, we don't think it means large changes. We think that the text does a really good job describing the way the Esri community already conducts itself. We expect that most people will simply continue to behave in the awesome way they have for all these years.

However, we do expect that people will abide by the spirit and words of the CoC when in "official" Esri spaces. This code has been adopted by Esri staff and someday it may apply at Esri events as well.

#### What about events funded by Esri?

In the future, this Code of Conduct may also cover any events that Esri puts on.

This Code of Conduct is all about how we interact as a community. It's about saying that the Esri community will be open, friendly, and welcoming. The core issue is about ensuring the conversations we have are productive and inviting for all.

Real-life events, however, require a bit more care. Esri wants to be sure that any events it funds have policies and procedures in place for handling harassment. It's especially important to us that real-life events take steps to protect the physical and mental security of their participants.

#### What happens if someone violates the Code of Conduct?

Our intent is that the anyone in the community can stand up for this code, and direct people who're unaware to this document. If that doesn't work, or if you need more help, you can contact conduct@esri.com.

#### Why do we need a Code of Conduct? Everyone knows not to be a jerk.

Sadly, not everyone knows this.

However, even if everyone was kind, everyone was compassionate, and everyone was familiar with codes of conduct it would still be incumbent upon our community to publish our own. Maintaining a code of conduct forces us to consider and articulate what kind of community we want to be, and serves as a constant reminder to put our best foot forward. But most importantly, it serves as a signpost to people looking to join our community that we feel these values are important.

#### This is censorship! I have the right to say whatever I want!

You do -- in *your* space. If you'd like to hang out in *our* spaces (as clarified above), we have some simple guidelines to follow. If you want to, for example, form a group where Esri is discussed using language inappropriate for general channels you are welcome to. We respect your right to establish whatever codes of conduct you want in the spaces that belong to you. Please honor this Code of Conduct in our spaces.
